Project Overview:

This project aims to create a relational database for managing student records, courses, faculty details, and their relationships within a college system. The database schema connects multiple entities such as departments, faculty, students, courses, and enrollments, reflecting real-world academic scenarios.
The project demonstrates how various tables interact, like how students enroll in courses, how faculty members teach those courses, and how departments manage the academic offerings.
